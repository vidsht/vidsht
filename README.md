🌀 **Code is my canvas**, and I’m forever chasing that sweet spot between logic and artistry.

Right now, I’m immersed in full-stack development, weaving together clean interfaces and smart backends to build things that don’t just work — they *resonate*.I love creating experiences that feel intuitive, purposeful, and maybe even a little magical ✨
